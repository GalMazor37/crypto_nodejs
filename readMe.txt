write 'npm install' to the terminal and once it finish use 'npm start' command to the terminal

I wanted to make it easy on the eye and to understand for the user to send the requests, didn't finish the verification part for the cachettl.
When the app starts it search for cachettl.jaon file and if not found i create one with default cachettl=15 and default adminId =123456.
** i noticed only at the end that the ?symbol= can more then 1 symbol

I know this is not the best project i could have done in the time i had, but i hope you will like it enough to let me prove myself next time
